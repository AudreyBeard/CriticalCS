# CriticalCS
This is a collaborative effort among undergraduate, graduate, and faculty researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. While the GitHub contributions page shows me (Audrey Beard) as the primary contributor, this is due to our tech stack (My Overleaf account synced to my GitHub repo for convenience).

Our contributors include:

- Jesse Ellin

It contains all former and existing work toward the Critical Computer Science
project. This is also linked to an
[Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tnbmsqgzmwdb)

Prior work (including former semesters and previous iterations of homework) can
be found in "Archive"), then by group, and then as each group sees fit.
Dividing by semester and by group will be done via branches. After that it is
up to each group to decide if they want to use branches or folders, but please
clearly label which method will be used.

If you create a new branch or a new folder, please add a README that explains
how the folders and files are organized and what is in that folder.
